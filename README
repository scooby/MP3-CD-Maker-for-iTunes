	MP3 CD Maker

	So iTunes already does this.
	But, as you probably noticed, you have to convert all your songs to MP3.
	Okay, that gets tedious, especially since a CD will hold 100 MP3s... 
	And after burning, I've got MP3 versions of my songs floating around my library.

	Solution 1: ditch iTunes for a good music library.
	Solution 2: this script.

	This script will:
	1. Step through any playlist, to include a Genius mix, or DJ shuffle.
	2. Skip over songs that are already MP3s.
	3. Clean up after itself as it goes.
	4. Automatically bail if there are 10 failures in a row. 
	5. Write a log to the desktop.
	6. Do a Pretty Good Job of figuring out what will fit on a CD.
		(Sorry, it doesn't attempt to calculate file system overhead.)
	7. Number as it goes.

	You need to:
	1. Set up a playlist.
	2. Start iTunes playing as though you were listening to the playlist.
	3. Hit pause.
	4. Run the script.
	5. It will prompt for a folder. Select an existing folder, or create a new one.
	6. Get a blank CD, and burn the contents of the folder.
	7. You're done!
